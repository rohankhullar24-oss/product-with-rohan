# Next-run hints

Written by the advisor stage at the end of each run. Read by Stage 1 (Shots question)
and Stage 3 (blog post) at the START of the next run, before they pick their topic.

These are Class A only: they steer *content selection* for the next run and nothing
else. They cannot change cadence, pause state, publishing volume, or this pipeline's
configuration. Anything a hint produces still goes through the full deterministic
check suite before it publishes, so a bad hint costs one rejected draft, not a bad
publish.

Rules the advisor must follow when writing this file:
- Maximum 3 open hints at a time. If there are already 3, replace the least useful
  one rather than appending a fourth.
- Every hint carries the run date it was written. Delete any hint older than 2 runs
  that has not been acted on: if it has not mattered in two weeks, it is noise.
- Hints are suggestions with reasons, not orders. A stage may ignore a hint if that
  run's own rules (type balance, tone balance, dedup) point elsewhere. Log it when
  that happens so the advisor can see its hint was overridden.

## Open hints

- **[2026-09-20] `strategy_gtm` and `metrics_analytics` lead at 6 rows; the other 6
  types (including this run's `root_cause_analysis` insert) now sit at 5.** Next run
  should default to one of `product_sense`, `guesstimate`, `behavioral`,
  `prioritization`, or `product_critique` per Stage 1's lowest-count rule.

- **[2026-09-19] This run's blog post (metric dilution / Simpson's paradox) interlinks
  directly with the same-run Shots question** (onboarding completion vs. Day-90
  retention). When a Shots question and a blog post land on the same diagnostic theme
  in one run, that's worth doing deliberately more often — it gives the blog post a
  concrete practice link instead of a generic dashboard pointer, and this run's post
  used exactly that. Consider it as a first option each run before defaulting to a
  fully separate blog topic, though Stage 3's own dedup/evergreen/tone rules still
  govern which topic actually gets picked.

## Recently retired

- Reorg/layoff-as-subject hint (2026-09-20): removed, not tracked as a hint anymore.
  Reorg and layoffs are now a permanent standing-rule exclusion in SKILL.md's Standing
  rules section, enforced there directly rather than depended on via hint memory.
- Same-event-across-categories dedup reminder (2026-08-13): folded into standard
  practice at this point — applied cleanly again this run (AIR/WeatherNext/Snowflake/
  Uber all distinct underlying events, no cross-category overlap) without needing the
  hint to prompt it. No longer tracked as an open hint.
- Teardown-surface duplication reminder (2026-08-15): out of scope for this job now that
  Stage 3b/teardown moved to `product-shots-teardown-substack` (split 2026-08-26). That
  task's own hints file, not this one, is the right place for it going forward.
- Substack-skip / Narrareach-subscription reminder (2026-08-13): superseded by the
  current SKILL.md standing rule (Narrareach unavailable, draft-only, no tool calls
  attempted). No longer an open question each run — nothing to act on.
- Jobs-recency verification reminder (2026-08-08): superseded by the staleness gate added
  to `check.mjs news` (P3, applied 2026-08-08). The gate now enforces this mechanically.
- Question-type tie-break reminder (2026-08-10 / 2026-08-13 / 2026-08-26): fully resolved
  this run — every type is now at an even 5 rows, see the new open hint above.
- Tone-balance reminder (2026-08-10): the last several regular posts (postmortem, PRD
  guide, decision memo, this run's AI-reorg framework piece) have all been constructive/
  equipping rather than doom-flavored, so this has not needed re-triggering since 08-13.
